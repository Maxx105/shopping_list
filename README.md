## Technologies
* This application uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
* It used the Router component in React.
* Mongoose ORM for database storage.
* It uses CSS/Bootstrap for styling.
* Deployed on Heroku.
* Passport for user authentication.
* JWT for the creation of a webaccess token.

## Usage
If using from the Heroku deployed application, just go to the deployed application's [link](https://basic-shopping-list.herokuapp.com/). Start by creating a user account. At that point, you can create a list name (maybe the name of the store, the date, the type of products, etc.). You can then click on that list and start adding items along with the quantity. You can click on the item to cross it off or you can delete items as well. If running off a local server, first do an npm install then run the server by running the "npm start" command in a gitbash terminal. This will initialize the React app.
